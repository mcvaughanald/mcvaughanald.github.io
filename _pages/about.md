I am a 5th year Ph.D. student in mathematics at Stanford, studying with [Richard Taylor](https://virtualmath1.stanford.edu/~rltaylor/). I previously did my undergrad at Harvard, and Part III at Cambridge.

My research interests are in algebraic number theory and arithmetic geometry. I'm broadly interested in the Langlands program, although I've been recently focused on p-adic automorphic forms, eigenvarieties, and Galois representations.

I can be reached at firstinitial k lastinitial at stanford dot edu.

## Research
Comparison of cohomological eigenvarieties, with Christian Johansson & Guillem Tarrach. [draft](https://mcvaughanald.github.io/files/Comparison.pdf)

Eigenvarieties over CM fields and trianguline representations. [arXiv.2054.18319](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18319)

Undergrad papers can be found on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/search/?query=McDonald%2C+Vaughan&searchtype=author&abstracts=show&order=-announced_date_first&size=50).
