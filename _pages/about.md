I am a 4th year Ph.D. student in mathematics at Stanford, studying with [Richard Taylor](https://virtualmath1.stanford.edu/~rltaylor/). I previously did my undergrad at Harvard, and Part III at Cambridge.

This fall, I am on the job market.

My research interests are in algebraic number theory and arithmetic geometry. I'm broadly interested in the Langlands program, although I've been recently focused on p-adic automorphic forms, eigenvarieties, and Galois representations.

I can be reached at firstinitial k lastinitial at stanford dot edu.

## Research
Eigenvarieties over CM fields and trianguline representations. [arXiv.2054.18319](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18319)

Undergrad papers can be found on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/search/?query=McDonald%2C+Vaughan&searchtype=author&abstracts=show&order=-announced_date_first&size=50).
